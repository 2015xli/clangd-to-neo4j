## Why This Project?

A Clangd index YAML file is an intermediate data format from [Clangd-indexer](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/indexing.html) containing detailed syntactical information used by language servers for code navigation and completion. However, while powerful for IDEs, the raw index data doesn't expose the full graph structure of a codebase (especially the call graph) or integrate the semantic understanding that Large Language Models (LLMs) can leverage.

This project fills that gap. It ingests Clangd index data into a Neo4j graph database, reconstructing the complete file, symbol, and call graph hierarchy. It then enriches this structure with AI-generated summaries and vector embeddings, transforming the raw compiler index into a semantically rich knowledge graph. In essence, `clangd-graph-rag` extends Clangd's powerful foundation into an AI-ready code graph, enabling LLMs to reason about a codebase's structure and behavior for advanced tasks like in-depth code analysis, refactoring, and automated reviewing.

## Key Features & Design Principles

*   **AI-Enriched Code Graph**: Builds a comprehensive graph of files, folders, symbols, and function calls, then enriches it with AI-generated summaries and vector embeddings for semantic understanding.
*   **Incremental Updates**: Includes a Git-aware updater script that efficiently processes only the files changed between commits, avoiding the need for a full rebuild.
*   **Adaptive Call Graph Construction**: Intelligently adapts its strategy for building the call graph based on the version of the `clangd` index, using the `Container` field when available and falling back to a `tree-sitter`-based spatial analysis when not.
*   **High-Performance & Memory Efficient**: Designed for performance with multi-process and multi-threaded parallelism, efficient batching for database operations, and intelligent memory management to handle large codebases.
*   **Modular & Reusable**: The core logic is encapsulated in modular classes and helper scripts, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
*   **Configurable Ingestion**: Provides multiple strategies for data ingestion, allowing users to choose between speed and safety based on their needs.

## Primary Usage

The two main entry points for the pipeline are the builder and the updater.

For all the scripts that can run standalone, you can always use --help to see the full CLI options.

### Full Graph Build

Used for the initial, from-scratch ingestion of a project. Orchestrated by `clangd_graph_rag_builder.py`.

```bash
# Basic build (graph structure only)
python3 clangd_graph_rag_builder.py /path/to/index.yaml /path/to/project/

# Build with RAG data generation
python3 clangd_graph_rag_builder.py /path/to/index.yaml /path/to/project/ --generate-summary
```

### Incremental Graph Update

Used to efficiently update an existing graph with changes from Git. Orchestrated by `clangd_graph_rag_updater.py`.

```bash
# Update from the last known commit in the graph to the current HEAD
python3 clangd_graph_rag_updater.py /path/to/new/index.yaml /path/to/project/

# Update between two specific commits
python3 clangd_graph_rag_updater.py /path/to/new/index.yaml /path/to/project/ --old-commit <hash1> --new-commit <hash2>
```

### Common Options

Both the builder and updater accept a wide range of common arguments, which are centralized in `input_params.py`. These include:

*   **RAG Arguments**: Control summary and embedding generation (e.g., `--generate-summary`, `--llm-api`).
*   **Worker Arguments**: Configure parallelism (e.g., `--num-parse-workers`, `--num-remote-workers`).
*   **Batching Arguments**: Tune performance for database ingestion (e.g., `--ingest-batch-size`, `--cypher-tx-size`).
*   **Ingestion Strategy Arguments**: Choose different algorithms for relationship creation (e.g., `--defines-generation`).

Run any script with `--help` to see all available options.

## Supporting Scripts

These scripts are the core components of the pipeline and can also be run standalone for debugging or partial processing.

*   **`clangd_symbol_nodes_builder.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Ingests the file/folder structure and symbol definitions.
    *   **Assumption**: Best run on a clean database.
    *   **Usage**: `python3 clangd_symbol_nodes_builder.py <index.yaml> <project_path/>`

*   **`clangd_call_graph_builder.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Ingests *only* the function call graph relationships.
    *   **Assumption**: Symbol nodes (such as `:FILE`, `:FUNCTION`) must already exist in the database.
    *   **Usage**: `python3 clangd_call_graph_builder.py <index.yaml> <project_path/> --ingest`

*   **`code_graph_rag_generator.py`**: 
    *   **Purpose**: Runs the RAG enrichment process on an *existing* graph.
    *   **Assumption**: The structural graph (files, symbols, calls) must already be populated in the database.
    *   **Usage**: `python3 code_graph_rag_generator.py <index.yaml> <project_path/> --llm-api fake`

*   **`neo4j_manager.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A command-line utility for database maintenance.
    *   **Functionality**: Includes tools to `dump-schema` for inspection or `delete-property` to clean up data.
    *   **Usage**: `python3 neo4j_manager.py dump-schema`

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This includes bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Feel free to try `clangd-graph-rag` on your own `clangd`-indexed projects and share your feedback.

### Future Work

The current roadmap includes:
-   Adding a wrapper layer for AI agentic tasks (e.g., an MCP server).
-   Extending the parsing and graph construction to support C++.
